# There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z' arranged in a circle with a pointer. A character can only be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is initially pointing to the character 'a'.

# Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

# Move the pointer one character counterclockwise or clockwise.
# Type the character the pointer is currently on.
# Given a string word, return the minimum number of seconds to type out the characters in word.

# Example 1:
# Input: word = "abc"
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# The characters are printed as follows:
# - Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
# - Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
# - Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
# - Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
# - Type the character 'c' in 1 second.

# Example 2:
# Input: word = "bza"
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# The characters are printed as follows:
# - Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
# - Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
# - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
# - Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
# - Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
# - Type the character 'a' in 1 second.

# Example 3:
# Input: word = "zjpc"
# Output: 34
# Explanation:
# The characters are printed as follows:
# - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
# - Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
# - Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
# - Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
# - Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
# - Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
# - Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
# - Type the character 'c' in 1 second.

# Constraints:
# 1 <= word.length <= 100
# word consists of lowercase English letters.
